# 🎓 TradEITI - Class Schedule Exchange App for Students  

## 🌟 Project Overview  

TradEITI is a **web application** designed to simplify the process of **class schedule exchanges** for students.  
During our first year of university, we identified a significant problem: the lack of a dedicated platform for swapping class hours between students.  

🚫 **The Problem:**  
Students often rely on rudimentary solutions like shared Google Docs, which are inefficient and time-consuming.  

✅ **Our Solution:**  
TradEITI aims to provide a **seamless and efficient platform** to empower students to manage their schedules effortlessly.
